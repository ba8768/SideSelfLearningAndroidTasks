<u>FragmentWorkOut:<u>
- This program creates three fragments. One fragment is a listfragment that lists the fragment lifecycle. The other fragment is a description of the lifecycle.
- The screens are different because I added a layout-large. 
- for the Smaller screens, the list comes up, which lists the fragment lifecycles. When you click on one, a new activity takes you to the description. 
- For the larger screens, the list is on the side and the description of the  lifecycle is on the right.
